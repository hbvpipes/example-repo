# Age Category Checker

This Python script asks the user to enter their age and responds with a relevant message based on predefined age categories. It's a basic demonstration of conditional logic and input validation in Python.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What the Program Does

Once the user enters their age, the program evaluates it against a series of conditions and returns a message that matches the age range. It includes a humorous and practical range of categories â€” from childhood to retirement â€” to demonstrate control flow using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

---

## ðŸ§  Logic and Categories

The program checks the user's age and prints:

- **Over 100**: "Sorry, you're dead."
- **65 or older**: "Enjoy your retirement."
- **Exactly 21**: "Congrats on your 21st!"
- **40 or older**: "You're over the hill."
- **Under 14**: "You qualify for the kiddie discount."
- **Any other age**: "Age is just a number."

## ðŸš€ How to Use It

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Save the script in a file (e.g., `age_checker.py`).
3. Run the program from the terminal:
   ```
   python age_checker.py
   ```
4. Enter your age when prompted.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements

Currently, the program assumes the user will enter a valid number. In the next version, input validation can be added to catch non-numeric or invalid inputs using `try`/`except`.
